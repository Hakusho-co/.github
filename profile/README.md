  <p>Extensible and Flexible Headless LMS</p>

## 🌅 Philosophy

After some research (just some simple Google search), there’s still no good solution for a headless LMS solution. Most of the existing solutions rely on a different platform (like WordPress), require complicated configuration, and are expensive.

Our target is to make something that is an easy and flexible headless platform for developers to integrate into their own applications. This also includes the extensibility and customizability of the platform.

### 🏷️ Name

Hakusho - **白書**

What is it about? Hakusho means **white paper** in Japanese. Like paper, we could fold and shape it to our liking, write on it, or even draw something on it. We also use paper for a really long time for various things, especially for technological growth and education.

## 📖 Open-source

  <p>We love open-source ❤️</p>

  <p>
    We believe that we can benefit people from our product like every other open-source code that we’ve used over the years personally. That’s why, we want to give back to the community so that maybe, we can help them to make something bigger for themselves.
